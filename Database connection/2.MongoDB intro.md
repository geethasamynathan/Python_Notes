# What is NoSQL?

**NoSQL** ("Not Only SQL") is a type of database that provides a mechanism for data storage and retrieval other than the traditional relational databases (RDBMS). NoSQL databases are designed to handle **unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data efficiently**.

# Why NoSQL?

## Scalability

Designed for distributed architecture, making scaling easier.

### Example:

MongoDB, a NoSQL database, allows horizontal scaling by distributing data across multiple servers (sharding). For example, an e-commerce website experiencing high traffic can distribute product data across different shards to improve performance.

## Flexibility

Schema-less or dynamic schema allows for easy modifications.

### Example:

A NoSQL database like MongoDB allows storing documents with different structures in the same collection. For instance, a user profile collection may have documents with different fields without requiring a predefined schema:
```sql

{
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 25
}

{
    "name": "Bob",
    "email": "bob@example.com",
    "preferences": ["sports", "music"]
}
```
## Performance

Faster read/write operations due to optimized data models.

### Example:

Redis, an in-memory data store, provides lightning-fast read/write speeds. It is used in caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed data, such as session tokens in web applications.

```python
import redis

r = redis.Redis()
r.set("username", "Alice")
print(r.get("username"))  # Output: b'Alice'
```
## Big Data Handling

Suited for large volumes of data and real-time applications.

### Example:

Apache Cassandra is used by companies like Netflix to handle massive amounts of streaming data efficiently. It provides high availability and fault tolerance, ensuring seamless content delivery to millions of users.
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_activity (
    user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    last_login TIMESTAMP,
    watch_history LIST<TEXT>
);
```
This table efficiently stores user activities in a distributed database for real-time access.

## 2. Why MongoDB?

MongoDB is one of the most popular NoSQL databases. It is a document-oriented database that stores data in JSON-like BSON format.

### Key Features of MongoDB:

**Schema-less:** No predefined schema is required.

**Scalability:** Supports horizontal scaling through sharding.

**High Performance:** Optimized for read and write operations.

**Flexible Data Model:** Documents can store nested structures.

**Rich Query Language:** Supports complex queries, indexing, and aggregation.


# NoSQL vs. RDBMS
| Feature         | NoSQL (MongoDB)              | RDBMS (MySQL, PostgreSQL)  |
|---------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Data Model** | Document-based (JSON/BSON) | Table-based (Rows & Columns) |
| **Schema**     | Dynamic Schema              | Fixed Schema               |
| **Scalability** | Horizontal Scaling         | Vertical Scaling           |
| **Query Language** | MongoDB Query Language  | SQL                        |
| **Joins**      | No Joins, uses embedded documents | Uses Joins for relationships |
| **Transactions** | Supports transactions (multi-document ACID transactions) | Strong ACID compliance |
