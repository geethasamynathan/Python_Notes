# Difference Between Abstract Class With and Without `@abstractmethod` in Python

In Python, using `@abstractmethod` in an abstract class (defined with `ABC`) is not strictly mandatory, but it serves an important purpose. Here’s the key difference between defining an abstract class **with** and **without** `@abstractmethod`:

## 1. Abstract Class Without `@abstractmethod`
If you define an abstract class using `ABC` **but do not use `@abstractmethod`**, the class behaves like a normal class. That means:

- You **can** create instances of the class.
- Subclasses **do not need** to override the method.

```python
from abc import ABC

class MyAbstractClass(ABC):  # Abstract class
    def some_method(self):
        pass  # No enforcement

# No error, can instantiate the class
obj = MyAbstractClass()

```
# 2. Abstract Class With @abstractmethod
When you use @abstractmethod, Python enforces that any subclass must override the method before it can be instantiated.

```python

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class MyAbstractClass(ABC):  # Abstract class
    @abstractmethod
    def some_method(self):
        pass  # Must be overridden in subclasses

# obj = MyAbstractClass()  # TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class

class ConcreteClass(MyAbstractClass):
    def some_method(self):
        print("Implemented in subclass")

obj = ConcreteClass()  # No error, works fine

```

## Key Differences
| Feature              | Without `@abstractmethod` | With `@abstractmethod` |
|----------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Instantiation       | ✅ Allowed              | ❌ Not allowed (unless subclass implements abstract methods) |
| Subclass enforcement | ❌ Not required         | ✅ Must override abstract methods |
| Use case            | Acts like a normal class | Ensures a contract for subclasses |


## When to Use @abstractmethod?
Use @abstractmethod when you want to enforce that all subclasses must implement specific methods. If you only use ABC without @abstractmethod, it acts more like a regular class and does not enforce implementation in subclasses.
